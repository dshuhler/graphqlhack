### GraphQL hackathon



GraphQL is usually sent via HTTP to a single server endpoint
  - use GET for queries
  - use POST for "mutations"


- spring boot
  - graphql-spring-boot-starter is not an official plugin. Is being updated but does not seem 
    widely used
  - no good library to assist with integration tests. should be able to abstract a lot away for
    cleaner tests
    
    
- graphiQL tool
  - basically postman for just graphQL
